//Made an array above in which we stored our hours as a string

 //Made another array in in which we stored the information about each store







//Function facilitates the the getting, creating & appending of the store totals and looping through pertanent code
//Fetches the HTML element with the ID of 'tfoot' and asigns it to tableFoot var
//Creates a table row elemnt in the DOM, assigns to tableRow var
// We take the 'tr'(which is in tableRow var) and append or put in the page
//Make a table data element, simalar to what is described above
//Giving data to the table data element, in this case a string 'Totals'
//Appending the child element we just worked with to our TableRow

//Need to start some variables to hold what will be looped through


 //For loop is iterating through our storeHours on line 4
//Setting the previously made variable to 0, guess I could have done this earlier?
//Made td, assiged it to the variable, THE ABOVE 2 ACTIONS WILL HAPPEN FOR EVERY STORE HOUR

//Double check if i's need to be j's
