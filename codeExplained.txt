//Made an array above in which we stored our hours as a string

 //Made another array in in which we stored the information about each store







//Function facilitates the the getting, creating & appending of the store totals and looping through pertanent code
//Fetches the HTML element with the ID of 'tfoot' and asigns it to tableFoot var
//Creates a table row elemnt in the DOM, assigns to tableRow var
// We take the 'tr'(which is in tableRow var) and append or put in the page
//Make a table data element, simalar to what is described above
//Giving data to the table data element, in this case a string 'Totals'
//Appending the child element we just worked with to our TableRow

//Need to start some variables to hold what will be looped through


 //For loop is iterating through our storeHours on line 4
//Setting the previously made variable to 0, guess I could have done this earlier?
//Made td, assiged it to the variable, THE ABOVE 2 ACTIONS WILL HAPPEN FOR EVERY STORE HOUR

I think that I have to use 'j's in the place of 'i's because i already defined 'i'
Add whats in CookiesPurchased/storeInfo is added to hourTotal when loop runs
What I think the loop does is it itterates through store hours, creating td elements, further more, it itterates through storeInfo
adding whats stated to hourTotal, finally adding adding hour total to daily total after the loop on line 31




DialyTodal finally is going onto the page




Simalar as the above process, making the head row 







Itterates through storeHours
basically creates a 'th'for every store hour I think
Adds the content of storeHours or index there of to the 'tr' above
puts all this on the page

Creates the 'th' for 'daily location total text'
Adds the actually text ccontent to the element
Appends the textual data to the page

Constructor function, provides the categories needed for the for the stores
the keyword this, allows us to acces the perameters of the store categories
And I forget, but I think by assigning the the parameters what we have here
allows for further utilization of the properties later...





Prototype is still mysterious, but evidently the function will round up and down
our min and maxCustomer when we need it to, its not in a loop





Uses the Prototype of storeCategories? to adda function on or w/ the Prototype


Itterates through storeHours
In order to multiply the rounded cookiesCount data and push or put that data on 

Adds cookiesCount to cookiesPurchasedTotal


I think we are using the Prototype of storeCategories again and adding a funciton again
calls calculateCookiesPurchased by utalizing this keyword
I think same deal as what has happend above a few times now get,creat,appned
